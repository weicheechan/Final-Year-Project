# Final-Year-Project

## Bachelor(Hons) of Business Analytics
**Title: Analytics for Smart Farming**

- Programming Language: Python

This study aims to provide a thorough study on the applications of data analysis in the sensors data and build a predictive model for forecasting the climatic variables.

*i.To investigate the characteristics of the climatic variables through exploratory data 
analysis.*

*ii. To forecast the value of climatic variables for the next 30/31 days through 
predictive modelling.*

*iii. To create a summary dashboard for visualizing the sensor data and crop yields 
information.*

## Diploma in Information Technology 
**Title: Smart Rubbish Bin**

- Programming Language: Arduino

The aim of Smart Bin System is to develop a waste management system that can detect the 
condition of the rubbish bin and send SMS to notify the user once it is full.

The objective of this project are shown as follows:

i. Research about the working principle and type of sensors available

ii. Identify the most appropriate components to construct the bin system such as the sensor, motor, microcontroller, control circuit, GSM module and 
software, etc

iii. Write algorithm that control the movement of the bin , detect the level of garbage and send notification

iv. Assemble the hardware components according to the circuit diagram
